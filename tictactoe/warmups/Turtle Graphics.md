# Drawing with Python

&nbsp;

Turtle is a whole mini-programming environment within Python. It's based on Logo - a language from the late 1960's that controlled a Turtle robot with a pen for a tail. The turtle would roll around in response to instructions. Tell it to make a circle & it would circle -- dragging its pen to draw. Later, a 'virtual' turtle was made & it would trace out vector graphics on a monitor.

Turtles have their own canvas, & always start out at **position (0, 0)** - which is the the **exact center of the canvas**. That's a little different from most other drawing programs like _processingJS_ or _HTMLcanvas)_, which start in the upper left & lower left corners of the screen, respectively.

Because setting this up on your computer may be a bit fiddly, we've provided links to both [**trinket.io**](https://tiny.cc/turtle_cheats) & [**Repl.it**](https://repl.it) -- throughout this doc.  They're environments that will allow you to play with the Turtle module online.

####  Simple Shapes Exercises

Using your shell & Turtle, or Repl.it/Trinket.io, draw the following shapes.
_We've provided solutions in the files...but no peeking till you've tried!_

*  Square
*  Triangle
*  Circle
*  4 Squares: 2x2
*  Equilateral Triangle
*  Right-Angle Triangle
*  Two Circles, Stacked
*  Two Circles, Next to Each Other
*  Hexagon (Hint: Each side is 1/6th of a circle...)
*  Octagon (Hint: Each side is 1/8th of a circle...)
*  6 Pointed Star (Hint: overlapping triangles)
*  5 Pointed Star (Hint: 144 is the magic number...)

#### More Complicated Shapes Exercises
We've linked to two more sets of example code that draw more complex shapes using while loops & a little bit of math.  See what changes you can make to this code to draw different shapes/use different colors.

*  What happens if you make the loop _negative_ -- counting down from a number instead of up?
*  What other colors or ranges could you add?
*  What other shapes can you achieve by varying the angles/repeats?
*  What else can you build based on this scaffolding code?
