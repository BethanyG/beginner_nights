# Lists & Tuples Exercises







1. Create a Tuple  using `tuple()` & then using `()`  _what is the difference between the two methods?_
2. Create a list using `list()` & then using `[]` _what is the difference between the two methods?_
3. What kinds of data can you put in a list?  What kinds can you include in a Tuple?



**sample_data** = ["apple", "pear", "banana", "cherry", "grape", "watermelon", "strawberry",

â€‹                             "mango" "pineapple", "blueberry", "blackberry", "raspberry", "peach", "plum"]



**second_sample** = ("dog", "cat", "parrot", "fish", "guinea pig" )



#### Using the "sample_data" list above:

1.  Return "plum", starting from the left-hand end.  How do you do it from the right-hand end?
2. Return "mango", starting from the left-hand end.  How about from the right-hand end?
3. Replace "raspberry" with "huckleberry".
4. Swap the positions of  "apple" & "cherry".
5. How would you alphabetize the list?
6. Delete "watermelon".
7. Add ["zucchini", "carrot", "onion"] onto the end of the list.



#### Using the "second_sample" Tuple above:

1. Return "parrot", starting from the right-hand side,  then from the left.
2. Return "guinea pig", starting from the right-hand side, then from the left.
3. Can you change "cat" into "elephant"?  Why or why not?
4. Make a new Tuple by re-ordering the content of the original Tuple.
5. Can you append the Tuple to the list?  Can you append the list to the Tuple?  Why/why not?
6. Add ("rat", "monkey") to the Tuple (_this is a bit of a trick question!_)
