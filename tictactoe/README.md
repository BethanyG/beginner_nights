#  TicTacToe :  Not Just a Kids Game!



Welcome!  In this first "beginner project", we're going to start with building a small TicTacToe game that we can "draw" & play on the command line.  Then we're going to refactor it & add a clickable GUI using the Python Turtle module.

_**Don't worry if this is all new to you**_  There will be more than enough time for questions & discussion as we move along. 

_**Don't be fooled by this "little game"**_   This small, contained project contains a lot of "bread a butter" data structures & logic you can use later on to tackle much more complicated problems.

_**Don't be intimidated**_  All this code is just an example and a place for you to get started with projects of your own.  There's no expectation that you master all of this - only that you start to play with many of the cool features that come packaged with core Python.



The topics touched on/covered are listed below, followed by a list/links to some warm-up exercises.  The main code files are in the tictactoe folder:



1. _**titactoe_stub.py**_ is an empty file with just the names of the functions we'll be writing.
2. _**tictactoe_first_pass.py**_ is a "first implementation" of the command-line ticttactoe game.  It doesn't include many data structures or other optimizations.
3. _**tictactoe_first_refactor.py**_ is a "refactor" or re-write of #2 above, with added data structures, comprehensions, ternary expressions, and list slices to "clean up" and compress the command-line code a bit.
4. _**tictatoe_add_turtle.py**_ takes the command-line tictactoe and re-writes it with a GUI using the Turtle module.
5. _**turtle_coords.py**_ is a bunch of functions to print out different figures and coordinates for use in the Turtle/GUI version of the game.
