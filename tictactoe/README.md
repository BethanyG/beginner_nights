#  TicTacToe :  Not Just a Kids Game!
&nbsp;

**Welcome!**  In this first "beginner project", we're going to start with building a small TicTacToe game that we can "draw" & play on the command line.  Then we're going to refactor it & add a clickable GUI using the Python Turtle module.

_**Don't worry if this is all new to you**_  There will be more than enough time for questions & discussion as we move along.

_**Don't be fooled by this "little game"**_   This small, contained project contains a lot of "bread a butter" data structures & logic you can use later on to tackle much more complicated problems.

_**Don't be intimidated**_  All this code is just an example and a place for you to get started with projects of your own.  There's no expectation that you master all of this - only that you start to play with many of the cool features that come packaged with core Python.

## Links to Code Files

_These are code files for the game at various stages.  You can find them all in the Tictactoe folder._



* [**titactoe_stub.py** ]()  is an empty file with just the names of the functions we'll be writing.

*  [**tictactoe_first_pass.py**]()  is a "first implementation" of the command-line ticttactoe game.  It doesn't include many data structures or other optimizations.

*  [**tictactoe_first_refactor.py**]()  is a "refactor" or re-write of #2 above, with added data structures, comprehensions, ternary expressions, and list slices to "clean up" and compress the command-line code a bit.

* [**tictatoe_add_turtle.py**]()  takes the command-line tictactoe and re-writes it with a GUI using the Turtle module.

* [**turtle_coords.py**]()  is a bunch of functions to print out different figures and coordinates for use in the Turtle/GUI version of the game.
